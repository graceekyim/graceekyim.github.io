			<!--Subtitle 1-->
			<p class="text">
				When I think of Dev Bootcamp, I'm excited, scared, anxious and thrilled all at the same time. Fortunately, it seems like I'm not alone in feeling this way. It's so comforting to know that we're all in this together. I'm grateful for the fact that I can get to know others in my cohort before we start Phase 1 and I'm especially grateful for all the prep work that we've been assigned. Phase 0 has definitely been more work than I had initially expected, but I like that it's forcing me to develop good habits early. Now that we're finishing week 1, I have a better idea of how much time I should set aside for the challenges and what to expect the next couple weeks.<br/><br/>

				I really appreciate what Shereef said about working together to go far and fast. I took a programming class last year where I preferred to work alone. I found that I could pick up new skills much faster and I liked that I didn't have any distractions. At the time, I didn't stop to think of how that might actually be hurting me. By not collaborating with others, I wasn't learning as much as I could. I know that everyone has unique strengths and weaknesses and working together as a team allows you to mutually benefit from each other's skills. I like that DBC stresses the importance of working together in pairs and teams and I plan to take advantage of this while I can. <br/><br/>

				DBC won't be easy, but I know it's definitely where I want to be.
