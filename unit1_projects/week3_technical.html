			<p class="text">

				JavaScript is a popular programming language for many reasons. It is not only easy to learn, it is a client-side language that can be executed quickly. Unfortunately, while it may have its strengths, there are some weaknesses, such as security that prevent it from being wholly reliable. <br/><br/>

				Here is a breakdown of some of the strengths and weaknesses of JavaScript.

				<table>
					<tr>
						<th scope="column" class="mainheader"><strong>Strengths</strong></th>
						<th scope="column"><strong>Description</strong></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>JS can change HTML and CSS</td>
						<td>By changing the Document Object Model, JS can change the HTML and CSS of existing web pages, making web pages interactive</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>JS code is executed quickly</td>
						<td>JS is a client side language, meaning that it is written into the HTML and executed by the browser. Since it is not accessed through the web server, it generally loads quickly.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>JS code is easy to learn</td>
						<td>JS is an object-oriented language and has many similarities to languages like Java and Ruby, making it easy for programmers to learn</td>
					</tr>
				</table>



				<table>
					<tr>
						<th scope="column" class="mainheader"><strong>Weaknesses</strong></th>
						<th scope="column"><strong>Description</strong></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>JS can be accessed by anyone</td>
						<td>Since JS is written into an HTML page, it can be accessed by anyone who is viewing the page</td>
					</tr><br/><br/>

					<tr>
						<td>JS can be unreliable</td>
						<td>Occassionally, JS can be rendered differently on different browsers, making it unreliable and inconsistent</td>
					</tr>
				</table><br/><br/>
