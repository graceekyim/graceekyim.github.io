				<h3>Thinking Style</h3>
				My thinking style is <strong>Concrete Random</strong> and I believe there are several ways this style will help me learn at DBC. First of all, concrete random thinkers thrive in an environment where they need to learn by trial and error. They enjoy experimenting and figuring out problems. Since we're learning so many new concepts at DBC, I think my love of experimenting will help me since I'm willing to take risks and fail to figure out a solution.<br/><br/>

				In addition, concrete random thinkers focus on practical processes and I think this approach will help me in coding. I will be able to apply my concrete perceptual abilities to work through problems in a logical and direct way.<br/><br/>

				One additional characteristic of concrete random thinkers is that we like solving problems independently. While this can be a good trait, I find that it's hindered me from asking for help. Whenever I hit a roadblock or I'm unable to figure out a problem, I have to remind myself that I'm not alone. Fortunately, the pairing sessions have helped and I find myself asking questions more often than I did the first two weeks of Phase 0.  <br/><br/>

				<h3>Learning</h3>

				One of the hardest challenges I've faced during Phase 0 is time management. This week was especially tough since I've been traveling between Chicago, Nashville and San Diego. Even though I spent most of my free time studying, I struggled to finish the challenges in time. When I return to Chicago this week, I should have a more predictable schedule and I'm hoping I can figure out a good routine for the remaining weeks of Phase 0. <br/><br/>
