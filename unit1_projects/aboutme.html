			<h1 id="head1">About Me</h1>
			
			<p class="text1">Welcome! My name is Grace and I currently live in Chicago, Illinois. I've been here for almost seven years since graduating from Wheaton College. <br/><br/>

			My first five years out of college, I worked in sports administration managing ticket operations and sales. While I enjoyed the work and travel, I realized that I didn't want to stay in the sports industry for the long term. Following that job, I spent some time working in fundraising, managing donor contributions and records, before moving into my current position as a database specialist. <br/><br/>

			I became interested in web development after taking a Java course and I look forward to learning more about programming at DBC.
