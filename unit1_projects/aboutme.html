			<h1 id="head1">About Me</h1>
			
			<p class="text1">Welcome! My name is Grace and I currently live in Chicago, Illinois. I've been here for almost seven years since graduating from Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois. <br/><br/>

			The first five years out of college, I worked at the U.S. Soccer Federation managing ticket operations and sales. Since leaving U.S. Soccer, I've been working at the Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago. I started in the resource development department, managing donor contributions and records before moving to my current position in the IT department as Database Specialist. <br/><br/>

			I became interested in web development after taking a Java course last year and I can't wait to get to DBC to start this next chapter in my life.
