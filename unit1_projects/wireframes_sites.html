			<strong>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there?</strong><br/>

			Since I usually visit The A.V. Club site to read recaps, I chose to create a wireframe of a <a href="http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/modern-family-wedding-part-1-204697" target="blank" class="links">recap page</a>. The page is trying to solve the program of providing a synopsis of an entire episode with one image, a written summary and some "stray observations."<br/><br/>

			One visual challenge is that the ad bar at the top of the page can be quite distracting. It looks like they tried to alleviate this problem by including a large image from the episode at the top of the post.

			<strong>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there?</strong><br/>

			Every Friday, Joanna (the blogger) writes a blog post consisting of links to other websites that she finds interesting. Since I always look forward to reading these posts, I chose to create a wireframe from <a href="http://joannagoddard.blogspot.com/2014/05/have-wonderful-weekend_16.html" target="blank" class="links">this past Friday</a>. The page is trying to solve the program of providing short descriptions of links to interest the reader so he/she will click on it and to make the links easily distinguishable from each other. <br/><br/>

			One visual challenge is that there are so many links in the post that they could be easy to miss. I think the designer did a good job of setting apart the links from the text by making it orange/coral. As a reader, my eyes are automatically drawn to each link and the short descriptions they provide.

			<!--Subtitle 3-->
			<p class="text"><span class="site1"><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">The New York Times</em></a></span><br/>
			
			<strong>What problem is the web page solving? What visual challenges are there?</strong><br/>

			The articles for the New York Times Magazine are generally longer and consist of various images and graphs. I chose to create a wireframe from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-gets-to-graduate.html?hpw&rref=magazine" target="blank" class="links">this article</a> from May 15, 2014. This page is trying to solve the problem of providing a lot of text without overwhelming the reader. They try to do this by including various images and graphs to break up the article.<br/><br/>

			There are a couple visual challenges on this page, the first of which is the quantity of images and links at the top of the page. Due to the location of the advertising and the links to other articles, the top of the page seems clustered. As you scroll down the page, there's a balance between images and text, but the advertising on the sidebar can get a bit distracting.
