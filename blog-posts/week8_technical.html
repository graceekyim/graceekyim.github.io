				<h2>Introduction to Web Security</h2>
				
				With the ever-increasing frequency of internet traffic, web security has become extremely important for users to keep their personal information secure. The topic of web security is massive and cannot be easily covered in one post, but below is a quick introduction to web security and the various dangers that lay out there on the web.<br/><br/>

				<h2>Malware</h2>
			
				Two of the more common malware, or malicious software, out there on the web are viruses and spyware. Viruses work just like you would expect - they infect your computer and can easily infect other computers that are connected to yours. They can spread throughout your computer and corrupt files so that they can no longer be accessed. <br/><br/>

				Spyware is another type of malware and generally enters your computer with a virus. Spyware will monitor your web traffic and will send this information to the person that distributed the spyware. This information can be something like secure financial information. <br/><br/>

				Malware is one of the security risks that can be minimized by installing anti-virus software. Furthermore, regularly updating software and browsers will increase the chances that your computer is safe from malware, since web companies are regularly patching up vulnerabilities in their products and making improvements. <br/><br/>

				<hr>

				<h2>Firewalls</h2>

				While anti-virus software will provide a basic level of protection for your computer, this will not prevent hackers from accessing your computer. This is where firewalls can help. Software firewall is a category of firewall that is housed on your computer and monitors the activity between your computer and other networks. This firewall can block outside users from gaining access to your computer, only allowing authorized activity to come through the web. <br/><br/>

				In addition to software firewalls, there are also external firewalls such as those found in some routers. These firewalls work similar to software firewalls and monitor the traffic that comes in through the router. They are especially useful in that they can allow you to share an internet connection with multiple computers. <br/><br/>

				<h2>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)</h2>

				One final topic we'll cover today is Internet Protocol Security (IPsec). IPsec <em>"is a protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet of a communication session"</em> (Wikipedia). IPsec uses encryption and authentication to protect web traffic. Since IPsec operates in the internet layer of the Internet Protocol Suite, it protects application activity over an IP network and does not require TSL/SSL certificates at the application layer. <em>(To learn more about Internet Protocol Security, check out the links below.)</em> <br/><br/>
