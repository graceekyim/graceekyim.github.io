			<h2>Emotional Conflict</h2>	

			Before I started working in database management at my non-profit organization, I spent approximately nine months working in resource development, where I helped manage contributions and donor relations for the organization. The position was new and there were a lot of aspects of the job that were still evolving and yet to be defined. One of those things was my position in the department's organizational structure. There were occasionally moments when I felt out of place and somewhat isolated in my job. While my supervisor was extremely encouraging and supportive, my peers didn't know much about my position and didn't seem to respect the work I did as much as I hoped. <br/><br/>

			This led to a conflict I had with a colleague where I felt extremely undervalued. She had made a remark about my position that overlooked any contributions I had been making to the department. Though our supervisor blatantly disagreed with the comment, she seemed unapologetic. <br/><br/>

			This same colleague had become a friend of mine and I was hurt not only as a colleague but as a friend. I chose to be direct with her and told her how I felt. We were able to talk through the situation and work past it by being honest and truthful. <br/><br/>

			<hr><br/>

			Throughout college, I had problems handling conflict with people in my life and it was only after I graduated that I started feeling like I had a better grasp of how to work through such situations. This particular situation is a good example of how far I've come in learning how to address conflict. Instead of ignoring or overlooking the emotional conflict, I decided to be direct with my colleague and this allowed us to work through the matter quickly and put it behind us. <br/><br/>

			While each conflict may call for different approaches, I do feel that talking through conflicts openly and honestly is the best way to handle them, especially when it's something that is bound to come up sooner or later. Consequently, I think it's best to address conflict and deal with it head on as soon as possible. <br/><br/><br/>
