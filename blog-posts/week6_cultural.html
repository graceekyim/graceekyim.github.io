			<p class="text">

				My first job out of college was in the sports industry and I felt the effects of "stereotype threat" on a regular basis. As a woman working in professional sports administration, I felt the need to prove that I was good enough to work in a male-dominated industry. While the pressure was unnerving at times, I was motivated to work that much harder and do my job well in order to overcome any stereotypes.<br/><br/>

				At times I wondered if my minority status as a woman would affect my ability to move up in the company. Fortunately, most of my colleagues were supportive and encouraging and never made my gender an issue. When I eventually decided to leave the company to pursue a different career path, I felt content that I had performed the best I could in my position and I had disproved stereotypes that may have existed about women in sports administration. <br/><br/>

				I believe working in the tech industry will present challenges similar to those that I faced in the sports industry in that I will be in the minority as a woman and I will feel a constant need to prove my worth as a result. Combined with "impostor syndrome," I'm sure these challenges will motivate me to work that much harder to prove my skills and make my voice heard. I recognize that stereotype threat may always exist to some degree in any work environment, but instead of ignoring it, I hope to use it to my advantage as a motivator to meet all the challenges that may lie ahead during my time at DBC and my future career in tech. <br/><br/>
