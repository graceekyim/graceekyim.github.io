				<h2>Personal Development & Growth</h2>

				A couple years into my first job out of college, I realized something was missing. While I enjoyed the company of my colleagues and the unique opportunities of working in sports administration, I felt little satisfaction from the day-to-day work I was doing. I started looking for ways to grow outside of my job and ended up taking a few classes at a university that gave me an outlet for learning something new. I also started looking for a new job and eventually found a position that challenged me and inspired me to build a new career. <br/><br/>

				Now that I've had a couple years to process that time in my life, I realize that I was lacking an opportunity for growth and personal development in that first job. I have learned that I thrive best in an environment where I am constantly challenged and learning something new. Having found that environment in my current job, I have seen a significant difference in how I approach my work and the satisfaction I get from the day-to-day responsibilities I have.<br/><br/>

				<h2>Values in My Life</h2>
				On a scale of 1-5, I would give myself a 4. In the years since I've graduated college, I've taken several classes in an effort to continue my personal development and growth. (Thanks to one of those classes, an intro to Java, I am now getting ready to attend DBC!) I am always eager to attend lectures and classes regarding topics that interest me, and I find that learning something new both stimulates and energizes me.<br/><br/>

				<h2>Advice</h2>
				The last time someone asked for my advice was when my friend was trying to decide if she should go to grad school. She needed some help determining whether it was the right option for her. While I am aware of the great benefits of pursuing a graduate degree, I believe a person should only go back to school if she is certain that she wants to stay in that field. Consequently, I tried my best to ask the right questions that would help my friend determine if she was considering grad school for the right reasons. <br/><br/>

				<h2>Values and Stereotype Threat</h2>

				I can see how personal development and growth were by-products of my experience with stereotype threat in the past. Whenever I was faced with stereotypes, I chose to fight against them and prove that I deserved to be there. That determination allowed me to grow professionally and to become a stronger person. <br/><br/>

				Since personal development and growth helped bring me to DBC in the first place, I'm hoping it will continue to help me through my time at DBC and the challenges I will face when I finish the program and start looking for jobs. I know there will be a lot of hardships ahead, but when I consider all the ways I will grow and be better equipped to be a programmer, I believe the hard work will have been worth it. <br/><br/>

				After struggling to find the right career path after college, it has been such a relief to have found an interest I want to pursue long-term. This has been a great motivation for me during Phase 0 and I hope it will help me throughout the rest of DBC.<br/><br/>
