				<br/><br/>
				As a new programmer, I believe one of the most important aspects of my education relies on my willingness to ask questions. As someone who prefers to research and find solutions on my own, it's been hard to ask questions when I need help. Fortunately, I've found the guided pairing sessions to be a great introduction to learning at DBC. I imagine the format of our programw will be similar to GPS in that we're working through challenges with a partner and asking for help from the teachers along the way. <br/><br/>

				Today, we'll cover some tips on how to ask good questions when you're learning how to code. Some of these pointers may help you in any scenario where you're asking questions, while others will only apply to the programming world. <br/><br/>

				Let's get started!<br/><br/>

				<h2>1. Do you understand your own question?</h2>

				When you're formulating a question, you should always ask yourself if the question would make sense to you if you were reading it for the first time. Since you're the one asking for help, it's easy to get wrapped up in a problem. You have to remind yourself that the person reading your question will be coming from a completely different situation. This means that you need to include enough detail to make the question understandable, without bogging it down with unnecessary information. <br/><br/>

				<h2>2. Should you include examples?</h2>

				Oftentimes, your question will be regarding a block of code you wrote that doesn't work. Anytime a question is regarding a snippet of code, you should include it in your question. If there's a syntax error or even (an embarrassing) grammatical error, it will be much easier for someone to find it by reading your code. <br/><br/>

				Speaking of grammar, this brings us to the next tip...<br/><br/>

				<h2>3. Did you proof-read your question?</h2>

				When you're writing a question with the intent of posting it on Stack Overflow or a similar site, you need to make sure you're proof-reading your writing. This will not only save yourself from embarassment, it will give you an opportunity to repeat step 1 and make sure the question makes sense to you. <br/><br/>

				<hr>

				<h2>4. Is your question title descriptive?</h2>

				If you're posting your question on a Stack Exchange site, your question title can affect the success rate of your question. If a title is not descriptive enough, a reader will not be inclined to read the question, and you don't want to be too specific, since you'll provide more detail once the reader clicks on the post. It's important to keep the title succinct and provide just enough information to have someone find and respond to your question. <br/><br/>
