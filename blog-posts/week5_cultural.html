				<h2>Pairing</h2>

				The most rewarding part of pairing so far has been the knowledge I've gain by working with someone who thinks differently from me. If I think of a solution, I can get immediate feedback and discover someone else's approach to solving the exact same problem. In an ideal pairing session, I think the partners would have comparable skills, making it easier to understand one another's suggestions and come up with a well-developed solution. There have been some pairing sessions where I felt unevenly matched with my partner - in some cases I felt I knew more and in others I felt I knew less. Fortunately, despite this discrepancy I've come away from every pairing session having learned something new about pairing and/or coding. Everything I've learned has helped me become a better programmer and I can see why pairing is such an integral part of DBC. <br/><br/>

				One of the challenges I've faced during pairing has been my own insecurities. I've been reluctant to speak up during some pairings due to a fear of giving the wrong answer. Thankfully, I've been getting better at speaking up as I've grown more confident in my skills and knowledge. While I recognize I have a long way to go, I know that we are all newbies and will only learn more by speaking up and getting feedback. <br/><br/>

				<h2>Feedback</h2>

				Initially, I was anxious to read my feedback and hear what my peers thought of me. When I read them I realized quickly that the feedback was beneficial and encouraging. Everyone was thoughtful and considerate in their suggestions, making it easier for me to reflect on the improvements I could make in future pairings. One thing I intend to work on is asserting myself in the pairing session and speaking up when I have suggestions. <br/><br/>

				Writing feedback was harder than I expected. I wanted to be kind and encouraging and I was hesitant to point out any flaws or weaknesses in others. When I started rating feedback in Socrates, I realized how important it is to make your feedback actionable. A lot of the feedback I read was kind and specific, but it wasn't always actionableand therefore not very helpful. It seems important that we develop good habits during Phase 0 and that's only possible if we know what to work on. I've appreciated honesty in the feedback I've received, and this has pushed me to make more of an effort to include helpful tips and suggestions in the feedback I give my peers. <br/><br/>

				<h2>Pairing + Feedback</h2>

				Overall, I believe pairing and feedback is extremely helpful and essential to the learning process at DBC. We are fortunate enough to be learning Ruby with a group of other newbies and we should take advantage of the collective learning experience, whether it's pairing, giving feedback or collaborating on group projects.<br/><br/>
