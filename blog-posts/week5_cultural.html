				<h2>Pairing</h2>

				After completing a good number of pairing sessions, I now understand how rewarding and challenging
				pairing sessions can be. The most rewarding thing would be the knowledge you gain by working with
				someone who thinks differently from you. If I think of a solution, I can get immediate feedback and
				hear how someone else processes and solves the exact same problem. In an ideal pairing session,
				my suggestions would be intertwined with my partner's suggestions to come up with a well-developed
				solution. At this point in our learning, it feels like we're stumbling a lot as we write code but I
				as we grow as programmers, I can see how pairing will be even more helpful and crucial at DBC. <br/><br/>

				One of the challenges I've faced during pairing has been due to my own insecurities. I was reluctant
				to speak up during pairings and was afraid of giving the wrong answer. Since then, as 
				I've started to grow more confident in my skills and knowledge. While I recognize
				I have a long way to go, I know that we are all newbies and I know I will only learn more by speaking
				up and getting feedback. I believe I've grown to be a better partner for pairing and I'm always learning
				how to improve as a pair and as a programmer.<br/><br/>

				<h2>Feedback</h2>

				Initially, I was anxious to read my feedback and hear what my peers thought of me. When I read them I realized
				quickly that the feedback was both kind and pra. Everyone was thoughtful and considerate in their suggestions,
				making it easier for me to reflect on the improvements I could make in future pairings. One thing I intend to
				work on is asserting myself in the pairing session and speaking up when I have suggestions. <br/><br/>

				Writing feedback was harder than expected at first. I wanted to be kind and encouraging and was hesitant to 
				point out any flaws or weaknesses. When I started rating feedback, I realized how important it is to 
				make your feedback actionable. While much of the feedback was kind and specific, it wasn't always actionable
				and therefore not very helpful. It seems especially important that we develop good habits during Phase 0 and 
				that's only possible if we know what to work on. I've appreciated honesty in the feedback I've received. 
				Therefore, I've been making an effort to include helpful tips and suggestions in the feedback I give. <br/><br/>

				<h2>Pairing + Feedback</h2>

				Overall, I believe pairing and feedback is extremely helpful and essential to the learning process at DBC. 
				We are fortunate enough to be learning Ruby with a group of other newbies and we should take advantage of 
				the collective learning experience, whether it's pairing, feedback, group projects or empathy sessions. <br/><br/>
