				<h2>Background</h2>
			
				Following Edward Snowden's leaks of classified National Security Agency documents, there have been many discussions regarding cybersecurity for Internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo.  In many cases, unbeknownst to these companies, the N.S.A. was exploiting weaknesses in their systems that would allow them to access clients' unencrypted data. At the same time, the N.S.A. was collecting data through legal channels by requiring companies to provide information regarding their customers.<br/><br/> 

				An underlying concern for many companies is the balance between accommodating legal measures and protecting customer data. The exposure of the N.S.A.'s underhanded activities has left companies reluctant to cooperate with spy agencies and has highlighted the need for increased security measures.

				<h2>Next Steps</h2>

				Many companies have already been taking strides to improve their cybersecurity. For example, Google has started to encrypt links between their data centers and Facebook has been taking measures to encrypt customer traffic.<br/><br/>

				While companies can take measures to protect their own data, there needs to be a larger effort to ensure that individuals have the privacy and freedom they expect. The hope is that the government will pass more comprehensive privacy reform, which could limit a government agency's permission to collect user data. While this may not alleviate all concerns regarding cybersecurity, it would help ease some anxiety for Internet users.<br/><br/>  

				The <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/" target="_blank" class="speciallink">Reform Government Surveillance</a> advocacy group, which consists of AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, has brought together Internet companies in a <a href="https://www.reformgovernmentsurveillance.com/USAFreedomAct" target="_blank" class="speciallink">joint appeal</a> to members of Congress to enforce stronger privacy protection for Internet users in the USA Freedom Act. Their request articulates the concerns and urgent need for reform and echoes the sentiments of many users around the world.<br/><br/>  

				Until the U.S. government implements stronger privacy protections for citizens and regulations for government agencies to abide by when conducting surveillance, individuals can make an effort to educate themselves on how to improve cybersecurity in their own lives. The <a href="https://www.resetthenet.org/" target="_blank" class="speciallink">Reset the Net</a> advocacy campaign provides tips for individuals on how to secure mobile phones, computers and web browsers. By taking matters into their own hands, citizens can prompt immediate and effective changes with the hopes that government reforms will soon catch up with the political protections we are entitled to.<br/><br/>
