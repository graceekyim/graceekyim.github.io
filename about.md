title: About
---

Approximately one year ago, I enrolled in a course in computer programming that introduced me to the world of object oriented programming. The course covered the fundamentals of Java and I was fascinated with this new ability I had to build a program using a collection of words and punctuation. This fascination triggered my decision to apply to Dev Bootcamp, and my enthusiasm for coding grew exponentially over the course of the 19-week program. As a recent graduate of Dev Bootcamp, I am thrilled to finally start my new career as a developer!

I thrive in an environment where I'm confronted with challenges that can be solved creatively. This stems from two passions I've had since I was a child: puzzles and literature.

Whether it's a crossword, Sudoku or a logic puzzle, I love the thrill of solving what was once puzzling. I love reading, writing and discovering the mystery behind people and places in fictional worlds. I believe both of these interests are combined in my love of coding.

When I’m coding, I feel like I’m tackling a puzzle and I’m fascinated by the creative process that goes into finding the best solution for the task. Because of the way coding aligns with my passions, working in development has inspired and motivated me in ways that no other job ever has.

I want to use the excitement and energy I have for coding to help you build your ideas into something wonderful. Contact me and let me know how I can help you make the next new, amazing thing!
