Welcome to my site! 

When I first graduated college, I was eager to start a career in sports administration and I was lucky enough to get a position in soccer events management. For almost five years, I traveled extensively, learning the ins and outs of event operations and sales. The sports industry was full of perks and I enjoyed all the unique opportunities I was given but I started to realize that it was missing something and started searching for that missing piece.

Through twists and turns in non-profit fundraising and database management, I'm so glad to have finally found what was missing - the potential for learning something new and solving problems every single day. So here I am, a web developer who is passionate about knowledge and the endless possibilities for growth in the programming world. 

I thrive in an environment where I'm given problems to solve and projects to complete. This overflows into all my other interests. I love puzzles, crosswords, jigsaws, sudokus and everything in-between. I love reading and discovering the mystery behind peoples and places in fictional worlds. I love writing code and seeing how numbers, words and symbols can create programs and objects that can be manipulated and molded to all our needs. 

I want to take this excitement and energy and help you build your ideas from nothing into something wonderful. Contact me and let me know how I can help you make the next new, amazing thing!
